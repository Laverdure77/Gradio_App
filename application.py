## Introduction

Are you fascinated by the diverse world of rocks ? Our app brings cutting-edge AI technology to the realm of geology, allowing you to explore and classify various types of rocks with ease.

## How it Works

Using the power of advanced image recognition algorithms, our app can analyze images of rocks and identify their types based on distinct features such as texture, color, patterns, and more. Whether you're an amateur rock enthusiast, a student, or a geology professional, this app is designed to assist you in classifying rocks efficiently.

## Key Features

- **Image Upload:** Simply upload an image of the rock you want to classify.
- **Crop Options:** Choose how you want to crop the image before resizing.
- **Instant Analysis:** Receive real-time results and insights about the rock's classification.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Our intuitive interface makes rock classification easy and accessible to all users.
- **Educational Tool:** Perfect for learning about different rock types and their distinguishing features.

## Getting Started

To start classifying rocks using our app, follow these steps:

1. Upload an image of the rock.
2. Select a crop option using the radio box.
3. Click on the "Submit" button to start the classification.
4. Explore the classification result.

## Rock Types

Here are the rock types that our app can classify:

{", ".join(class_names)}

## Embrace the World of Geology

Join us in unraveling the mysteries of rocks through the lens of AI. Whether you're identifying rocks you've collected or simply curious about the geological makeup of the world around you, our Rock Classification Computer Vision App is here to assist you.
